# Power BI - Calculated Columns and DAX Measures: README
This README outlines the steps to create calculated columns and DAX measures in Power BI based on the Employee dataset. Follow these instructions to enhance your data model and create insightful visualizations.

## 1. Calculated Columns
## 1.1 Age Group
This calculated column categorizes employees into specific age groups: 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 50+.

**DAX Formula:**

Age Group =<br> 
IF(Employee[Age] <= 30, "20-30", <br>
IF(Employee[Age] <= 40, "31-40", <br>
IF(Employee[Age] <= 50, "41-50", "50+")))

## 1.2 Tenure Band
This calculated column groups employees based on how many years theyâ€™ve worked at the company: 0-4 Years, 5-9 Years, and 10+ Years.

**DAX Formula:**

Tenure Band = <br>
IF(Employee[YearsAtCompany] < 5, "0-4 Years", <br>
IF(Employee[YearsAtCompany] < 10, "5-9 Years", "10+ Years"))


## 1.3 Bonus Eligibility
This calculated column determines if an employee is eligible for a bonus based on whether they have worked at the company for more than 5 years.

**DAX Formula:**

Bonus Eligibility = <br>
IF(Employee[YearsAtCompany] > 5, "Eligible", "Not Eligible")<be>

## 2. DAX Measures
### 2.1 Total Salary
This DAX measure calculates the total salary of all employees in the dataset.

**DAX Formula:**

Total Salary = SUM(Employee[Salary])

### 2.2 Average Years at Company
This measure calculates the average number of years that employees have been with the company.

**DAX Formula:**

Avg Years at Company = AVERAGE(Employee[YearsAtCompany])

### 2.3 Attrition Rate

$$ Attrition Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Employee, Employee[Attrition] = "Yes")), 
    COUNTROWS(Employee), 
    0
) $$
